  // a new product-listing can only be created by a cultivator (origin).
  // All other user types essentially just re-list a purchased product, changing Basic Information.
  // All re-listed products are linked back to origin via the tracking object.

  // A Product gets cloned at purchase (with updated tracking data), but can't be re-listed until it
  // has been delivered to the purchaser (order.delivered_date exists and is not null).

  // Ex: Manufacturer buys 1 kilogram of flowers from Distributor.
  // Manufacturer re-lists it as a new product-listing, changing the price
  // and unit_size to reflect the newly refined product-listing's properties.
  // If Manufacturer chooses gram as the unit_size thatâ€™s 1000 units_total.
  // App handles changing the units_total and units_available as needed.
  // Manufacturer may change:
  //     product_type (purchased flowers, selling wax)
  //     product_class (if created by combining two products) < - - - IMPORTANT
  // Manufacturer will sell the new product-listing BACK to the distributor. This third product-listing will be a clone of a clone
  // with different tracking data and possibly different Basic Information. Welcome to inception.

  // If a buyer returns purchased product in the full amount, that product can be deleted from that user's "bucket" in the database for cleanliness.

  //
  // Basic information
  // editable by product-listing creator (or re-lister)
